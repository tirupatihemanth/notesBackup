html - HyperText Markup Language
xml - Extensible Markup Language
xhtml - Extensible Markup Language
xhtml -1.0 translational is mostly used
linking to an external style sheet 
this has to be done in head as the <style type="text/css"></style> we use is in head tag
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
javascript files can be linked to your files
or you can use <script></script> 



<html></html>
<head></head>
<title></title>
<body></body>
<p></p>
<br /> to have blank lines
<strong></strong> for bold
<em></em> to italisize
<style type = "text/css"></style> to write css elements type attiribute tells the browser to interpret the tag
<h1></h1> are the tags for headings
<ul></ul> unordered list with each element in it seperarated by <li></li>
<ol></ol> for ordered list with each element in it seperated by <li></li>
for above tags like <h1><p> etc., we can use attribute style="color:#fffffff;" all css rules can be written over there
Doctype are instructions to the viewer's web browser which define which version ofHTML the page has been written
DTD - document type definitions

<span class ="className"></span> to selectively apply css styles to page content without modyfing page layout. You don't have to always span we can use others also like <em></em>
understand the difference between content and layout

To structure layout of our page we use div tags combined with ID 
to isolate the content to a region all we use are ID's we declare ID
#IDname{
	property and values
	background-color:#ffffff;

}
<div id ="mainContent"></div> to receive formatting and layout content on our html page 

#idName p,#idName  ul{
	//it says for all instances for p and ul in the elemets in the div that has this id }this has to be done in <style></style> tags as they come under css
layout adjustments must be done after applying color and font and other content Structure changes have been applied
<img src = "image path relative to the html doucment or the absolute url if on web" width="723" height="723" alt="image couldnot downloas this text will be displayed when this image couldnot be located or displayed"/>

adding an anchor tag

<a href="http://www.google.co.in" target="_blank">this is a link</a>launches in next tab if not given target it opens in the same window and in the same tab

<a href="other html paths">name of the anchor tag</a>
<a href="mailto:tirupatihemanthkumar@gmail.com">tirupatihemanthkumar@gmail.com</a>to locate i.e to go up a directory just use <a href="../goToFolder/some.html">go back to previous page</a>

making links to specific parts of a given page
first create the area we want to link to then establish a link
we are uing this id attributeonly to have a named instance of the destination anchor the id must be unique
<a name="someRegion" id = "somenameoftheanchor"></a> //at the target region

at the source location<a href="some.html#somenameoftheanchor" >name of the link here</a>

<table width="specify the width in % or px" border="1" cellpadding="space between the contents of the cell and cell wall" cellspacing="0"></table>cellspacing conrol spacing between the cells
<caption>here this caption is displayed at the top of the table</caption>
<tr></tr> for a row
<td></td> for a column use width for each td to specify the width of each column we have also align ="left" valign="top"
<td colspan="4"></td> this makes 4 columns cells span(i.e merge) there 4 represents no. of cells you would like to spell
<td rowspan="2"></td> makes those many vertical cells space next don't make any those cells

we can change the headings in table as <th></th> instead of <td></td>
definiton list
<dl>definitonlist
<dt></dt>definition title
<dd></dd>definition data
</dl>
definition lists are just to make definition title indented when compared to definition data

forms:

//you must have name as attribute for forms

<form method="post" action="someurl where you want to send to ">
<input name="query1"></input>
<input name="query2"></input>
<input type="submit" value="submit"></input>
</form>
<input type="text"></input>
here using type as password gives anotherway
<textarea/> creates an area for typying some information
in this we have some attributes like rows="5" and columns="30"
 
type="email" then we can give email
some of these types are provided by html5

Selections:
select list
single/multiple select
radio buttons where if you select one other one can't be selected
Check boxes here you can have multiple inputs are allowed

we use 
<select>
<option label="Developer" selected select="3" multiple></option>
//select show three in list with scrollnar and multiple helps to select multiple
<option label="programmer" ></option>
<option label="hacker"></option>
<option label="Network Professional"></option>
//the above way tells you how to give options
//that option is set by default
</select>
You can make some of the above options under some groups
<optgroup label="technical"></optgroup>
<optgroup label="non-technical"></optgroup>
<input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">Male</input>
<input type="radio" id="female" name="gender" value="female">Female</input>
<input type="checkbox" id ,name ,value //these are to be provided>first item </input>
<input type="checkbox" id ,name ,value //these are to be provided>second item </input>
if you have already given the value and kept an attribute readonly="true" THAT PART OF THE FORM WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FILLED AND WILL NOT BE EDITED
if you use disable value="true" that value will not be sent to the database
for inputs like names size="10" and maxlength="20" this makes 10 chars visible but after 20 your input will not be taken


<input type="submit" value="submit"></input>//here value is posted on the buttons
<input type="reset" value="Start over"></input> resets form data without refreshing the page
<input type="image" src="source path" alt="for screen reader if used"></input>
<input type="button" value="Push button"></input>//this button is just a push button no form submission occurs
<button type="submit" value="true" name="buttonSubmit"><span>text displayed on the button you can use all css styles and others for this type of buttons only</span></button>

label is text particularly associated with the field
the texts that we have used for input fields can be made label by doing as below
<label for="id of the field i.e male"><input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male">Male</input></label>
now because of label we can click Male also not just the button

Field sets we can group some of the input parts or contents

<fieldset><legend>title of group of field sets</legend></fieldset>
use attribute tabindex="1" or 2 or then we can go into any page where we want
