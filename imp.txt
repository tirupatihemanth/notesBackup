fscanf();
fread();
fprintf();
fwrite
fseek(fileptr, offset, fromwhere) i.e offset is in bytes and fromwhere is from where you would like to set the offset and fileptr is the file ptr considered
feof returns a non zero value if the file pointer is at the end of the file
rewind puts the file pointer to the beginning of the file 
Read about the linked list question

ps -u username gives the list of process run by the user
ps -A gives list of process run by all the users
ps just displays list of running processes
came to know about the strchr function in c which is used to know the number of occurences of a character in a string It can also be used to find the number of tokens(say);





$ df

The command above will display the directory path of your various drives. Take note of the drive you wish to format.

df-command-unixmenIn this tutorial, the name of the drive am going to format is Seth and its path under the filesystem is /dev/sdc1.

3. Unmount drive using the syntax below:

$ sudo umount /dev/sdc1

umount4. Now run this command to format drive to fat32:

$ sudo mkfs.vfat -n 'Ubuntu' -I /dev/sdc1

mkfs.vfat-unixmen

Understanding the above command

mkfs

mkfs is used to build a Linux filesystem on a device, usually a hard disk partition. The device argument is either the device name (e.g. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a regular file that shall contain the filesystem. The size argument is the number of blocks to be used for the filesystem.

vfat

Formats the drive to FAT32, other formats available are mkfs.bfs, mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, mkfs.ext4, mkfs.minix, mkfs.msdos, mkfs.vfat, mkfs.xfs, mkfs.xiafs etc.

-n

Volume-name sets the volume name (label) of the file system. The volume name can be up to 11 characters long. The default is no label. In this tutorial my volume-name is Ubuntu.

-I

It is typical for fixed disk devices to be partitioned so by default, you are not permitted to create a filesystem across the entire device.
