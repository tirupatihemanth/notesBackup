xml extensible markup language
It was defined for exchanging information through internet
Tags in xml describe content istead of formatting of the data(in case of html)
xml 
	-tagged elements
	-attributes
	-text(Are strings inside elements)
A well formed xml must have single root element, matched tags and proper nesting, and unique attributes
Schema is flexible in case of xml where as it is fixed in relational model of exchanging and storing data
Also ordering is implied in case of xml by the structure you have made in xml document but relational is ordered
we have simple query languages to query relational like mysql whereas xml we have a little tougher languages
we display xml in browser by converting it to html using css or extensible styleshee language(XSL)
A valid xml must adhere to well formed xml rules and also content specific specification
Content Specific Specification languages are : document type descripters DTD, XML schema     
In DTD we specify elements,attributes,nesting,ordering,#occurences Also special attribute types like ID IDREF
IDREF AND IDREFS are used create pointers i.e they refer to corresponding ID in the xml document
usually dtd's are specified before the xml document

Similar to DTD WE HAVE XSD OR XML SCHEMA
speciality is XSD ARE written in XML
