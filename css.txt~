Css defines the way we want to display our html files
<stlyle type="text/css"></style> if you write in html file css goes inside css
to select a html element with css we use
body{code goes here.......}  a body tag selector
background-color: #ffffff;
margin-left:20%;
margin-right:20%;
border:1px dotted @fffffff; a border for element specified
padding:1px;space inside the border
inner elemetns when given different styling options will override the things of the outer elemets or the elements in which this tag is
color:#000000; this is we can set color for elements
if we add padding to the paragraph it will be done for the space specified by the paragraph tag
css is also a markup language used to seperate the formatting of the html files from the basic structure and the architechture of the html file
we format of html using using SELECTORS,PROPERTIES AND VALUES
h1{color:#ffffff;} here {} is decleration block h1 tagis selector color is property and its value is given
font-size:12px;
font-weight:normal;or give px for weight;

To define a class in css style sheet:
to selectively apply styles we use classess
.className{
	write property and value pairs here
	color:#ffffff;
	
}
<span class ="className"></span> to selectively apply css styles to page content without modyfing page layout. You don't have to always span we can use others also like <em></em>
 
multiple selectors can be used by using a ,comma seperator   h1,h2{property and values}

adding Pseudo classes
links has following states associated with them
visited,unvisited,hover,active
using pseudo classes we can change or make above actions happen

selector:pseudoClass{
	property:value;
}
selector is some tag pseudoClass available for anchor tag is link
a:link{properties just before anything to happen}
a:visited{properties just after visited}
a:hover{properties while hovering}
a:active{properties while clicking}

The css box model

this used to structure the content on the box model

just think an element as enclosed by a box

to expand the space between content and box this is called padding
we can make a border at that box borders space b/w content and border is padding
beyond that border we can define some space that is called a margin

we can apply class to particular tags of an element using
ul.squarBulletPoint{
	list-style-type:square;
}
for ordered list list-style-type:upper-roman;

we use div tags and id's to control layout of our structure

position:absolute;//relative to the browser window we have to specify property
we have four properties i.e left right top bottom
left:460px; distance from the left;
top:68px; distance from the top;

In relative position we are going to make changes w.r.to current position
relative positioning:
position:relative;
style = "position:relative;left:20px;"that part will move by 20px withoutdisturbing any other parts

to fill in other elemets over floating objects we use floating objects
instead of using position:absolute relative and other we use float
float:right; always stays to right even on moving
on resizing also if we want to change width of different elements
set using just margin so that it's width can varying in 


clear:right;this makes anyfloats on the required elemets;

overflow:scroll;
this makes anything more can scroll
height:400px;
margin-left:auto;
margin-left:auto;
makes the element centre
all the above are used for layout using id's and div's
fixed positioning;
position:fixed;
top:200px;
left:0px;
i.e it doesn't scroll with the page
