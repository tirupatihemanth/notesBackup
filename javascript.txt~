where do you put java script is important
where ever browser finds it it runs it there itself
<script src="myscript.js" type="text/javascript"></script> after running all the html thing in the body
just put this script tag over there this is a good practice i.e just before the closing body tag
style sheets are to be put in the top


var variableName;
if(){}   //conditional syntax

=== strict equality check i.e same equality and type
x=5;  and x="5"; are same for double equal and for === they are difficult
== equality 
just it's good to create functions before calling the functions

create functions
 function functionName (any arguments){
  
 }
 
 we Have to call the functions necessary
 functionName(any Arguments here);
 you don't have to write  anywhere the return type or anything
 
 var anArray=[];
var multipllValues =  new Array();//you can give size as argument else just get a dynameic array
is another way;
 anArray[0]=1; ect.,
 you can put in anytype of data
 nameArray.length();
 var revArray =nameArray.reverse();
 .join();prints joined values by commas
 we can use .sort();
 var myArrayOfLinks = document.getElementByTagName("a"); // here we get an array
 `var today = new Date(); //current date and time
 today.getMonth();//returns 0 to 11 today.getFullYear();//today.getDate();//gives 1-31 day of month today.getDay();//gives 0 to 6 for day i.e sun to sat
 var y2k = new Date(year,month,date,hours,minutes,seconds);//variable number of parametres
 similar to getMethods we can use setMonth setDay setfullYear();
 if(object1.equals(object)); getTime gives time in milliseconds since 1970
 
 toCreate object easily
 var objec1 ={name:"hello",score:"hello"}; //is sufficient
 object1.name gives them out
 
 
DOM - document object model
document is our html code
object is something on the document that makes some sense
element node text node(is where text is written)
 
classes and id's can be attributed to any elements but a group of elements can have a single class but id is unique for a particular element
var myElement = document.getElementById("someId");
var myLinks = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
 myElement.nodetype
