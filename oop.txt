we can't inherit multiple classes but we can implement multiple interfaces
We can declare Interface variables but we can't instantiate an Interface
Can use only final(or constant) variables in a class
If you are not going to implement all the methods declared in Interface which subclass implemented it has to be an abstract class
All methods in abstract classes are by default public and all variables are public static final (static because anyways you don't have any instantiation)
Interface doen't declare constructors
